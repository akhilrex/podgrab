<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Podgrab is a is a self-hosted podcast manager which automatically downloads latest podcast episodes. It is a light-weight application built using GO.

It works best if you already know which podcasts you want to monitor. However there is a podcast search system powered by iTunes built into Podgrab

*Developers Note: This project is under active development which means I release new updates very frequently. It is recommended that you use something like [watchtower](https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower) which will automatically update your containers whenever I release a new version or periodically rebuild the container with the latest image manually.*

__Also check out my other self-hosted, open-source solution - [Hammond](https://github.com/akhilrex/hammond) - Vehicle and Expense management system.__

### Motivation

Podgrab started as a tool that I initially built to solve a specific problem I had. During the COVID pandemic times I started going for a run. I do not prefer taking my phone along so I would add podcast episodes to my smart watch which could be connected with my bluetooth earphones. Most podcasting apps do not expose the mp3 files directly which is why I decided to build this quick tool for myself. Once it reached a stage where my requirements were fulfilled I decided to make it a little pretty and share it with everyone else.

## Installation

The easiest way to run Podgrab is to run it as a docker container.

### Using Docker

Simple setup without mounted volumes (for testing and evaluation)

```sh
  docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=podgrab akhilrex/podgrab
```

Binding local volumes to the container

```sh
   docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --name=podgrab -v "/host/path/to/assets:/assets" -v "/host/path/to/config:/config"  akhilrex/podgrab
```

### Using Docker-Compose

Modify the docker compose file provided [here](https://github.com/akhilrex/podgrab/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) to update the volume and port binding and run the following command

```yaml
version: "2.1"
services:
  podgrab:
    image: akhilrex/podgrab
    container_name: podgrab
    environment:
      - CHECK_FREQUENCY=240
     # - PASSWORD=password     ## Uncomment to enable basic authentication, username = podgrab
    volumes:
      - /path/to/config:/config
      - /path/to/data:/assets
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    restart: unless-stopped
```

```sh
   docker-compose up -d
```
### Build from Source / Ubuntu Installation

Although personally I feel that using the docker container is the best way of using and enjoying something like Podgrab, a lot of people in the community are still not comfortable with using Docker and wanted to host it natively on their Linux servers. Follow the link below to get a guide on how to build Podgrab from source.

[Build from source / Ubuntu Guide](docs/ubuntu-install.md)
### Environment Variables

| Name            | Description                                                             | Default |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| CHECK_FREQUENCY | How frequently to check for new episodes and missing files (in minutes) | 30      |
| PASSWORD        | Set to some non empty value to enable Basic Authentication, username `podgrab`|(empty)|
| PORT            | Change the internal port of the application. If you change this you might have to change your docker configuration as well | (empty) |  

### Setup

- Enable *websocket support* if running behind a reverse proxy. This is needed for the "Add to playlist" functionality.
- Go through the settings page once and change relevant settings before adding podcasts.
